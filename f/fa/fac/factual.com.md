# Factual | Privacy Policy

Factual values the privacy of the users, subscribers, publishers, members, and others who visit the Site or Services, as defined below (collectively or individually, "users"). This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and disclose information collected through certain types of our services, as well as our corporate websites. Factual offers a wide variety of location and point of interest data and services to its partners, some of which are purely analytical or geographic in nature (for instance, matching places to location coordinates), while others involve the use of data from end users and their devices. This Privacy Policy relates only to those latter services, that involve end user and device data. The Factual services that include end user data are referred to as the “Services” and the website that this privacy policy is on is the “Site.” This policy does not apply to companies that Factual does not own or control or to people that Factual does not employ or manage. For information about how we collect and use information through our corporate websites, please see Section 6. 

Factual has been awarded TRUSTe's Privacy Seal signifying that this privacy policy and Factual’s practices have been reviewed by TRUSTe for compliance with [TRUSTe’s Web Privacy and TRUSTed Data program requirements](https://www.truste.com/privacy-certification-standards/) including transparency, accountability and choice regarding the collection and use of your information. The TRUSTe programs cover only information that is received through Factual’s website and Factual’s third party partners for its data enrichment services. 

Factual complies with the U.S. – E.U. Safe Harbor framework and the U.S. - Swiss Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data from European Union member countries and Switzerland. Factual has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view Factual’s certification, please visit http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/. 

* ## The Services

As mentioned above, Factual offers a variety of services that do not involve the use of end user data. Because no end user data is involved on those services, this privacy policy will focus only on the “Services” defined above, meaning those Factual services that do make use of end user data. Factual provides Services that help application developers, publishers, advertisers, marketers and other companies and organizations to learn more about their users and customers, based on de-identified and anonymous geolocation data. We likewise help advertisers and marketers to market in more relevant ways to consumers, including their own customers. To provide these Services, we may for instance create anonymous data sets from location data derived from unique (but anonymous) devices and the individuals that use them (“Users”). We may then use this data in aggregated and anonymous ways, to help marketers tailor ads to Users based on those Users’ inferred preferences and activities. We may use similar data sets to help applications and services learn more about their own Users, and to help our customers to map places and tie their likely (anonymous and/or aggregated) audiences to those places. Sometimes, we create toolsets and utilities from geolocation data, for other audience or data analytics purposes. The above list is not exhaustive, but it is intended to provide illustrative examples of how we use the data we collect and obtain. 

To perform our Services, we may partner with other parties such as brands, advertising agencies, media platforms and publishers (such as app developers) and other advertising platforms (our “Partners”). These Partners may help us to enhance our datasets, or to deploy our data in a way that helps customers, such as marketers or app developers. 

* ## The User Information Factual Receives In Order To Provide the Services

When you engage with our Partners (e.g., by using their mobile applications or viewing an ad provided by our Partners) we may collect or receive information (collectively, “Information”) about you, your location, your device, your online activity or the ad you are viewing. This Information sometimes may (but does not necessarily) include the following: 

  1. the geolocation data of your mobile device and an identifier, which may be expressed by precise latitude/longitude and/or at a GPS-level. The identifier may be a device ID from the user’s mobile device, such as the IDFA for iOS devices or Android ID for Android devices. 

  2. a User’s age, gender, date of birth and other information, if the User provided it to us or to a Partner. 

  3. other information about your device, such as: device type (e.g., tablet, smartphone), operating system, IP address, network provider, browser type (e.g., Firefox, Chrome, Safari), SDKs running on your device, time-stamp, International Mobile Equipment Identify (IMEI) identifier, time zone, or other unique device identifiers; 

  4. Information about the ad you have viewed, such as: what ad you have viewed, and what type or category of content the ad includes, where the ad is being served (e.g., what website or app), and any click or view activity related to the ad (e.g., whether you view or click through it). 




The Information that we receive from our Partners may be combined with additional anonymous or de-identified information we collect or receive from 3rd party sources. The Information we have or receive (such as unique and device identifiers) may be associated with geographic locations (based, for instance, on latitude/longitude) and other information (e.g., census data), used to create interest-based segments, or combined with other demographic, interest-based and business information. 

* ## How Factual Uses Information

Generally speaking, Factual uses the Information to operate, maintain, enhance, and provide our Services, and sometimes to partner with other platforms and services that provide analytics, marketing and advertising services (i.e., the types of Partners we’ve described above). Factual also uses the Information to understand the usage trends and preferences of our Users and our Partners’ Users, to improve the Services and to create new features and functionality. 

We often use the Information (including Information received from our Partners) to help determine demographic and interest attributes about Users, on an anonymous or de-identified basis. We may assign demographic or interest-based segments to a user based on their location(s) and provide this information to our Partners to enable them to provide more relevant content, services and advertising, For instance, if we often see (or if our Information suggests) that a particular device is present at or near music venues, we may infer that the (anonymous) user of that device enjoys music, and that User may receive information, ads or offers about music concerts in a relevant geographic area. 

We may also provide analytic tools or information based on our Information, which provide our Partners with information about their own customers or prospective customers, about the performance of their content, services and advertising (for instance, what effect certain ads, as opposed to other ads, have), or about trends or behaviors among anonymous or aggregate Users (for instance, what types of Users generally tend to shop at certain stores). 

* ## When and With Whom Factual Discloses Information

As part of our Services, we may provide Information (including in the form of demographic and interest segments of Users) to certain of our Partners. Their use of the Information is not covered by this privacy policy. For instance, we may share the Information as follows: 

  1. With Web Publishers, App Developers, and Advertisers. We may share the Information in order to assist web publishers, app developers, and platforms that work with them, to better understand their customer or user base. For instance, we may help an app that serves music to its users understand more about its users’ likely interests, based on aggregate or anonymous user behavior. Or, we may provide similar analytics services to advertisers, based on our Information. 

  2. With other Partners and platforms. We may share the Information with other platforms and service providers – for instance, companies that serve ads, provide insights, or provide other marketing services to advertisers and marketers. For instance, we may integrate our Services or partner with platforms that provide web-based advertising or analytics services, to help marketers send more relevant ads to their own customers. Sometimes, we may share the Information so that we or our Partners may reach customers across multiple channels – for instance, to find similar or common users on web and mobile devices, based on common Information or behavior. Sometimes, we may share the Information in order to enhance or verify the accuracy or completeness of it. 

Some of these Partners may use cookies or web pixels in order to send you targeted ads, engage with you, or otherwise locate you. For more information about cookies and web pixels, please review the relevant parts of Section 6. 

  3. Factual may disclose Information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with applicable laws respond to a court order, judicial or other government subpoena, or warrant in the manner required by the requesting entity. We may also disclose Information if we believe it is necessary to protect ourselves, our Partners, or any other person or third party, or to enforce any legal rights. 

  4. In the event that Factual is acquired by or merged with a third-party entity or is potentially going to be acquired by or merged with a third party entity, or if its substantial assets are acquired by a third party, we may transfer or assign the Information that we have collected from Users (or from our own direct customers and account-holders, including our Partners) as part of that actual or potential merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. 



* ## Your Choices and How to Opt Out of Interest-Based Advertising

As we’ve described above, we may use Information to enable advertising that is more tailored to Users’ inferred interests, preferences and locations, and to help companies and marketers learn more about their actual or intended audiences. If you prefer not to have ads tailored to you in this way, you may opt out of those Services, including our creation of demographic information and interest segments used to target those ads, by [clicking here](https://www.factual.com/privacy/opt-out). Please note that if you opt out in this way, you may still receive non-tailored (generally, less relevant) ads that are not based on your inferred interests. 

You also may opt out of mobile app interest-based advertising through your mobile device settings, as described below, and as applicable to most (but not necessarily all) mobile devices. When we receive a signal that you have done so, we will honor that signal and no longer use information collected through your mobile apps to deliver interest-based advertising to your device. 

**Please note:** We provide the below information purely for reference, and do not guarantee that is accurate or up-to-date as to the device that you are using: you should review the current, applicable device settings and other information provided by Apple and Google respectively, for the most current and accurate information about how device settings operate and how they permit ad targeting and data collection to be limited. 

**Opting Out on iOS Devices Such as iPhones, iPads or iPods**

If you have an Apple device, you can opt out of Factual’s app-based tracking for interest-based advertising by updating to iOS 6.0 or higher, and setting Limit Ad Tracking to ‘ON’. You can do this by clicking on Settings -> General -> About -> Advertising and toggling Limit Ad Tracking to ‘ON’. Our systems are designed to respect your choice and not use information to provide interest-based advertising based on data collected automatically from apps when this setting is ON. 

**Opting Out on Android Devices**

If you have an Android device, you can opt out of Factual’s app-based tracking for interest-based advertising by taking the following steps: 

  1. Open the Google Settings app on your device 

  2. Select “Ads” 

  3. Opt out of interest-based ads 




Our systems are likewise designed to respect these choices transmitted by your Android device. 

In addition to the above mobile-based choices, we sometimes work with web-based partners, such as to coordinate and integrate information across platforms. Many of these partners provide their own opt-out mechanisms, available at the Network Advertising Initiative, or [NAI’s opt-out page](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/). You can opt out of additional targeted advertising services by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance’s opt-out page, at http://www.aboutads.info. 

* ## The Information Factual Collects Through Its Corporate Website

  1. **Information and PII Collected on our Site.**

We may also collect Information, including personal information that you submit to us (“PII”) through our corporate websites, including any website on which this Privacy Policy appears (collectively, the “Site”). In order to use some elements of the Site, users may be required to register or to provide certain user-provided, PII including name and email address. In addition, we may conduct surveys, offer sweepstakes and make other opportunities available that require you to provide personal information such as your name and email address. 

Our server logs also automatically collect information such as your IP address, pages you access, your browser type and language, and the date and time of your visit, which helps us track users’ movements around our site and understand trends. 

We may assign your computer one or more cookies which may collect information to facilitate access to our website and to personalize your online experience. We, and third-party service providers with whom we partner, may use standard Internet tools such as cookies and web beacons, which collect information that tracks your use of our website and enables us to customize our services. These cookies and web beacons may be set by our third-party partners and service providers to assist us in managing the content on our Site and in understanding how users interact with our Site. These technologies collect non-personal information about your visit to our Site. Factual does not control the third party technologies employed on its Site for this purpose. 

If you have provided us with your email address, we will use your email address, without further consent, for administrative communications such as notifying you of major Site and Services updates, for customer service purposes, to address copyright infringement or defamation issues, to contact you regarding any content that you have posted to or downloaded from the Site or Services, and/or to provide you with additional information and service offers (e.g., our newsletter). If you do not want to receive promotional emails, please [notify us](https://www.factual.com/contact#other), or follow the unsubscribe instructions within the email. 

Factual may use “cookies” and similar technologies (see a description in Section 6) to: (a) automatically update the Factual application on your system; (b) remember your information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you access the Factual Platform; (c) monitor aggregate site usage metrics such as total number of visitors and pages accessed; (d) provide such metrics to Users as they pertain to such User’s uploaded content; and (e) track your entries, submissions, and status in any promotions or other activities. We may also work with service providers that use cookies, to show you ads about our own services. 

We may disclose user information to affiliated companies or other businesses or persons to: provide web site hosting, maintenance, and security services; fulfill orders; conduct data analysis and create reports; offer certain functionality; and assist Factual in improving the Site or Services and creating new services features. 

  2. **What are “Cookies,” and “Pixel Tags” and How Do We Use Them?**

Cookies are small data files that contain a string of characters, such as an anonymous unique browser identifier. Cookies are stored on your computer or other device and act as anonymous tags that identify your device, but not you personally. Our servers, or those of a Partner we work with, may send your device a cookie when you visit a website, including our Site, or a web page on which their ad or content is shown. A pixel tag (also commonly known as a web beacon or clear GIF) is an invisible 1 x 1 pixel that is placed on certain web pages. When you access these web pages, pixel tags generate a generic notice of the visit and permit us, or our Partners, to set or read our cookies. Pixel tags are used in combination with cookies to anonymously track the activity on a site by a particular device. When you turn off cookies, pixel tags simply detect an anonymous website visit. 

We or our Partners may use cookies to, among other things, “remember” you (including when you visit our Site), track user trends, and collect information about how you use websites or interact with advertising. We use cookies to provide relevant content to you and replace non-relevant ads with ads that better match your interests. 

  3. **Disabling Cookies**

Most web browsers are set up to accept cookies. You may be able to set your browser to warn you before accepting certain cookies or to refuse certain cookies. However, if you disable the use of cookies in your web browser, some features of our Site, or our Partners’ websites or services, may be difficult to use or inoperable. 



* ## Our Commitment to Data Security

Factual uses physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Factual, and you do so at your own risk. In other words, there is no guarantee that any Information you provide may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.
