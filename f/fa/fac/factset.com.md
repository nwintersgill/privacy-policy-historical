# FactSet Privacy Policy — FactSet Research Systems

Thank you for visiting the website of FactSet Research Systems Inc. and its affiliates (“FactSet” or “we”). FactSet is a provider of integrated financial information and analytical applications to the global investment community. To better protect your privacy, FactSet wants you to know how we collect your information, the types of information we collect, how we use and share your information and what choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.

For information collected from residents of EU member states and residents of Switzerland, FactSet complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework, as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union and Switzerland. FactSet has certified that we adhere to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view FactSet’s certification, please visit <http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/>.

I. Notice. FactSet will notify you about the purposes for which it collects and uses your personal information. You may contact FactSet’s compliance officer using the contact information provided below with any inquiries or complaints or to request information about the types of third parties to which we may disclose your personal information and the choices and means we offer for limiting use and disclosure of your personal information.

II. Choice. If you do not want your personal information to be disclosed to third parties, you may choose to prohibit disclosure of your personal information unless disclosure of your personal information is required by law or legal process or necessary to provide services to you. We will not disclose your sensitive personal information unless you specifically authorize us to do so.

III. Onward Transfer. FactSet will only transfer your personal information (i) as required by applicable law or regulation, including pursuant to a valid court or governmental order or subpoena; and (ii) to those representatives of FactSet, such as FactSet’s affiliates, employees, subcontractors, and vendors, (collectively, “Representatives”), who have a need to access your personal information for purposes of providing services to FactSet or to you. When FactSet transfers personal information to one of our Representatives, we will ensure that the Representative (1) subscribes to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles, (2) is subject to the EU Data Protection Directive or another equivalent EU or Swiss finding (as applicable) that its privacy practices are adequate, or (3) enters into a written agreement with FactSet requiring that the third party provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles.

IV. Access. FactSet will enable you to access your Personal Information held by FactSet and you will be able to correct, amend, or delete that information where it is inaccurate, except (1) where the burden or expenses of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to your privacy in the case in question, or (2) where the rights of persons other than you would be violated. If you wish to access your personal information held by FactSet, you may do so by contacting FactSet’s compliance officer using the contact information provided below.

V. Security. FactSet takes reasonable precautions to protect Personal Information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.

VI. Data integrity. The personal information FactSet collects is relevant for the purposes for which it is to be used. FactSet takes reasonable steps to ensure that such personal information is reliable for its intended use, accurate, complete, and current.

VII. Enforcement. FactSet is committed to working with individuals to obtain a fair resolution to any complaints or disputes about privacy and personal information. Please contact us using the contact information provided below if you have any questions or concerns regarding this privacy policy or our practices. For information collected regarding residents of European Union member states, FactSet agrees to cooperate with the Data Protection Authorities located in the European Union member states in resolving any individual complaints or disputes with regard to this Privacy Policy and the European Commission’s Directive on Data Protection. For information collected regarding residents of Switzerland, FactSet agrees to cooperate with the Data Protection Authorities located in Switzerland in resolving any individual complaints or disputes with regard to this Privacy Policy.
