# Privacy Policy | Socialbakers

This Privacy Policy was last updated in February 2019. 

Your privacy is our concern, and we are serious about it. This Privacy Policy explains what type of information Socialbakers may collect, hold and process in connection with provision of any Socialbakers’ products, services, content, applications, or websites (referred to collectively as the “Services”), and how that information is used and protected. It also sets out how you can contact us if you have any queries or concerns regarding your personal data. 

We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time. Please check the Privacy Policy periodically for changes, although, if you are our customer, we may also notify you via email of any changes that, in our sole discretion, materially impact your use of the Services or the way we process your personal data. Your continued use of our Services covered by this Privacy Policy will signify your acceptance of any and all changes to this Privacy Policy made by us from time to time. 

This Privacy Policy is issued by Socialbakers a.s., with its registered office at Pod Všemi svatými 427/17, Severní Předměstí, 301 00 Plzeň, Czech Republic, company ID No. 290 98 271, registered in the Companies Register maintained by the Regional Court in Pilsen, file B 1627 (“Socialbakers” or “we). 

## 1\. About Socialbakers

Socialbakers is a provider of Software as a Service (SaaS) AI-Powered solution for social media marketing. For more information about Socialbakers, please see the “Company” section of our site at <https://www.socialbakers.com/company/>. 

## 2\. Data we collect or receive

We collect personal data from our customers and users of the Services (which includes employees of our corporate or institutional customers) for our own purposes, such as to provide and administer the Services. We are the data controller in respect of this personal data. 

In order to provide our Services, we analyse user profiles and other information that we receive directly from the social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and other, via these platforms’ APIs. Such data include both non-personal data such as various statistics and metrics and personal data of the platforms’ users. Where we source the data directly from the relevant platforms, via these platforms’ public APIs, we determine the purpose of processing, which is developing and constantly enhancing our Services and offering them to our customers on a world-wide basis, via our web platform. In such cases, we are the data controller with respect to such data. 

We also process personal data on behalf of our customers as a data processor; this is when the provision of certain Service or specific feature requires that our customers give us a permission (such as, for example, an access token or other administrative permission), within the Service, to access and manage any information that our customers monitor or collect from social media sites; this may include information that is not publicly available. When we access customer’s data with respect to which the customers are the data controllers, we act in accordance with the instructions of our customers (which they give us through the Services) as their data processor. This will be, for example, when we access Facebook Insights or facilitate and organize the communication (e.g. Facebook messages) between the customer and its end users within our customer care feature of the Community Service. 

## 2.1 Data of customers and users of our Services

We collect your personal data when:

  * You register or use registration for our Services, by completing a web registration form; 
  * You log to our Service, either by entering your username (email) and password, or using a social login such as Connect with Facebook or Sign In with Twitter, or by any other similar authentication means that we may make available to you; 
  * You use our Services or otherwise interact with Socialbakers, for example when you publish any images, content or other files or data via our Services; 
  * You otherwise voluntarily provide such data, e.g. by filling out and submitting any forms made available to you through Socialbakers’ website or the Services or through websites or services of our business partners. 



When you create an account with Socialbakers, we will ask you to complete a registration form indicating your first name, surname, email, company, and job title. You can also choose to add a phone number to your account. 

You can log in to the Services with your user name. In such case, you provide to us your user name (email) and password. The password is hashed and Socialbakers does not see it. 

If you log in to our Services using your social network account, we receive basic personal details from your social network profile. The scope of details we receive depends on your social network account privacy settings and on your settings when logging into our Services; they might include your social network ID, public profile information (such as name, profile picture, gender, age range, or country) and e-mail address. We may also receive additional information from your profile if you give us permission to access it. If you wish to change the scope of your social network profile information that we receive upon your registration, you should review the privacy policy or other guidance available on your social network’s website and change your privacy settings. 

For purposes of analysis and improvement of our Services, our servers may automatically record information when you visit our website or use some of our Services, including: 

  * URL; 
  * IP address; 
  * Browser type and language; and 
  * Date and time of your request or action, including your actions within the Services such as history of how you use our Services. 



If our Services are purchased by an entity, it is the individual users within such entity’s organization who log into our Services platform and whose personal data are collected, as described above. Where such entity provides us directly with any personal data of its employees or other individual users that it authorized to access the Services, it must have all necessary consents, permissions or registrations to process and to provide to us its employees’ or users’ personal data. 

## 2.2 Social network user data

The type and scope of personal data obtained from social media platforms depends on the type of the APIs and permissions set out by the respective platforms, and on the administrative permissions granted to us by our customers, where applicable 

Below are the most typical examples of data collected about social media platform users: 

  * Basic user profile information (such as the user name, user photo); 
  * User generated content (such as posts, comments, pages, profiles, images or feeds) including its metadata (such as time and location of a post or comment); 
  * Contact details (such as name, email address, telephone number) if made public by the user; 
  * Additional individual information (such as age, gender, employer, profession, geographic location, education information, financial status, habits and preferences) published by the user. 



We only process data that the social network users made available to general public, pursuant to the relevant platforms’ terms, and that are generally accessible via the social network APIs, or data that our customers grant us permission to access. 

## 3\. How we use the data

Where we use your personal data for our legitimate interests, we make sure that we take into account any potential impact that such use may have on you. Our legitimate interests don’t automatically override yours and we won’t use your information if we believe your interests should override ours unless we have other grounds to do so (such as performance of contract, your consent or a legal obligation). If you have any concerns about our processing, please refer to details of “Your rights” in Section 11 below. 

## 5\. Retention periods 

We retain your personal data for the period necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy and/or any Services agreement, unless a longer retention is required by law (e.g. for tax or accounting purposes or due to other legal requirements) or storing of the data is needed for the establishment, exercise or defence of Socialbakers legal claims; in such case, we will store only the data necessary for the enforcement of our claims or our defence for the period necessary in the given case and not exceeding the statutory limitation periods. 

## 6\. Sharing your personal data for legal and business purposes
