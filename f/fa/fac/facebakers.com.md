    * You otherwise interact with Socialbakers, in particular when you use the  “Sign In with Facebook” or similar button on our website; and/or
    * You otherwise voluntarily provide such data, e.g. by registering with your e-mail address and password or by filling out and submitting a form made available to you through Socialbakers’ website or the Services.

If you log in to our Services using your social network account, we receive basic personal details from your social network profile. The scope of details we receive depends on your social network account privacy settings; however, they might include your social network ID, public profile information (such as name, profile picture, gender, age range, or country), e-mail address, birthday, work history, hometown and current city. We may also receive additional information from your profile if you give us permission to access it. If you wish to change the scope of your social network profile information that we receive upon your registration, you should review the privacy policy or other guidance available on your social network’s website and change your privacy settings

We also may collect any personal data concerning you or any third party that you have chosen to make accessible to general public, e.g., through Facebook APIs, on various social networks or anywhere else on the internet. 

For purposes of analysis and improvement of our services, our servers may automatically record information when you visit our website or use some of our Services, including:

    * URL;
    * IP address;
    * Browser type and language; and
    * Date and time of your request.

If our Services are purchased by an entity, it is the individual users within such entity’s organization who sign for our Services and whose personal data are collected, as described above.
