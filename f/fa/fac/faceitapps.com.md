Your privacy is important to Apps-O-Rama ("AOR"). We want the way our applications gather, store, and use your information to be transparent.

## Information We Collect

The applications that make up the Services make use of information provided by Facebook. When you authorize one of these applications, you have granted permission to Facebook to share certain personal information with the application. AOR complies with Facebook's rules and regulations governing what information we may keep and how long we may keep it.

Facebook allows applications to retain the User ID indefinitely, even if the user has de-authorized the application.

A Placeholder Email Address is a coded email address that can only be used by the application to send you an email. An application may use your Placeholder Email Address to contact you only if you give the application permission to do so.
