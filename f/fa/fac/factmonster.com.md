Information You Provide to Us:

Learning Network endeavors to provide you quality information that is tailored to your needs. In order to do that we sometimes need to ask you for information so that we can provide the kind of content you want, when you want it. We want to customize our site for you so that it meets your needs as fully as possible--this includes customizing articles, discussions, banners and more. We may ask you to register or provide personal information when you visit certain areas of Learning Network, enter a contest, play games, complete surveys, subscribe to a service or to a newsletter, submit content, or ask us for information. 

We consider the following to be personally identifiable information: first and last name, e-mail address, street address, zip code, phone number, and credit card number. We only collect personally identifiable information from you when you voluntarily submit it. Providing your personal information to Learning Network is optional. If you choose not to register or provide personal information you can still use our site but you will not have access to customized information. 

Depending on the particular Learning Network site with which you register, we may ask for your name, age, address and/or zip code, e-mail address, name of school or district, and/or grade level. If you are under 18 years of age, we will also ask you to provide your parent’s or guardian’s e-mail address. We may also ask you to choose a user name and password to use when you log in to the site. 

  
How We Use the Information You Provide:

We use the personal and demographic information you provide us to tailor the content, services and advertising on Learning Network to meet your current and future needs. Use of this data allows us to customize your experience by showing you content according to your preferences. From time to time, we may share the personal information you provide to us with our agents, third parties who are affiliated with our site, or with carefully selected companies so you can receive information that we believe may be of interest to you. We may use this information to inform you of product upgrades, special offers, updated information, and/or new services. We will also use your contact information to ship purchases made at Learning Network Store. Financial information that you share is only used to check your qualifications. 

If, however, the information provided is from or about an individual under 18 years of age the information will be used solely by Learning Network for internal purposes only and the information will not be shared with third parties. To find out more about our kids' privacy policy click here: WE PROTECT KIDS’ PRIVACY. 

  
Choice/Opt-out:

Learning Network gives you the opportunity to opt-out of having your personal information used for purposes not directly related to your use of the Learning Network sites. If you register for any of the Learning Network programs or services but do not want your data shared with third parties for marketing or promotional purposes you can opt-out at any time by sending us an e-mail at [optout@learningnetwork.com](mailto:optout@learningnetwork.com). To help us update your records correctly, please indicate in your e-mail if you are opting out of postal mail, e-mail or telemarketing communication. Please also provide your registration details including first name, last name, street address, city, state, postal code, and country.   
  
We Protect Kids’ Privacy:

As a parent, you’ve probably done a lot of thinking about protecting your family’s privacy on the Internet. Well, we’ve been thinking about it, too. We are working hard to provide you with the best information and the highest quality interaction on the Internet in an environment that is safe. In compliance with COPPA (Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act), we have adopted the following policies to keep kids safe: 

    1. We will NOT knowingly collect, use or distribute personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13 without prior verifiable consent from a parent or guardian. 
    2. We will NOT knowingly collect, use or distribute personally identifiable information from teens between the ages of 13 and 17 without first notifying a parent or guardian.
    3. Personally identifiable information we collect from children under the age of 13 will be used solely by Learning Network or its agents for internal purposes only and will not be sold or otherwise distributed to third parties. 
    4. We will NOT knowingly allow a child under the age of 13 access to chat rooms, message boards, e-mail accounts, or other services within Learning Network that would allow them to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable information without prior verifiable consent from a parent or guardian. 
    5. We will NOT knowingly allow a teen between the ages of 13 and 17 access to chat rooms, message boards, e-mail accounts, or other services within Learning Network that would allow them to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable information without first notifying a parent or guardian. 
    6. We will NOT knowingly ask a child or teen to divulge more information than is needed to participate in any activity, game, or service. 
    7. We will NOT knowingly provide any direct link to Websites that are unsuitable for children or teens. 
    8. Learning Network will not advertise on any site that does not comply with the regulations set forth under COPPA. 
    9. We will advise children under the age of 13 that they MUST obtain permission from their parent or guardian before sharing ANY personal information. 
    10. Upon request, Learning Network will provide a parent or guardian with a description of the information that may have been provided about their child or teen during a registration process for a program or service of this site. Learning Network only asks for a child's or teen's personal information if it is necessary to participate in the program or service. For example, use of the Learning Pod requires a parent or teacher to set up an account for their child or student by providing the child's first name, last initial, grade level and school zip code. This information is used to track the child's progress through the activities and exercises in Learning Pod and is only accessible to the person who set up the account via a secure password. The site administrator also has access to the registration data but it is only used for site maintenance. Registration data that is provided about children or teens is not used for marketing and is never shared with any other party. If you would like to view your child's registration data, request a change, or request that we delete any of your child's personal information, please send an e-mail to [kidsprivacy@learningnetwork.com](mailto:kidsprivacy@learningnetwork.com) which includes your child's first and last name, school zip code, and your first and last name. 



Learning Network encourages parents and guardians to spend time online with their children. We urge parents to instruct their children to never give out their real names, addresses or phone numbers, without permission, when using the Internet. We recognize a special obligation to protect personal information obtained from children. 

If you have any questions about our Kids' Privacy Policy please call Learning Network at 1-800-323-4776. 

Notification and Verifiable Parental Consent:

Certain areas and activities within Learning Network ask visitors under the age of 18 to provide personal information such as their name, date of birth, e-mail address or school name. We only ask for the information that is necessary to participate in the particular activity. 

Before any personally identifiable information is collected, we will do our best to notify the parent or guardian that their child or teen is participating. Notification will include the exact nature and intended use of the information we are collecting, as well as the opportunity for the parent or guardian to prevent the use of the information and the child’s participation in the activity. If the child is under 13 years of age we require the parent or guardian to provide verifiable parental consent such as an e-mail, mail-in letter, fax or toll free phone call to Learning Network. If the individual is a teen between the ages of 13 and 17, Learning Network will notify the parent or guardian that their teen is participating and sharing personal information but we do not require consent. 

When verifiable parental consent has not yet been obtained, we will use online contact information (such as an e-mail address) only as is appropriate to: 

  * request the name or online contact information of a parent or guardian for the purpose of obtaining verifiable parental consent or providing notification to the parent or guardian;
  * respond directly to the child’s or teen’s request on a one-time basis (for example, to provide assistance with a particular study question), not using that information to re-contact the child or teen for any other purpose;
  * respond more than once directly to a specific request from the child (for example, to satisfy the request for a newsletter subscription), not using that information to re-contact the child or teen for any other purpose.



What are Cookies?

The use of cookies is common in the Internet industry; you'll find them used on Learning Network, as you will at other major sites. "Cookies" are small text files written to your computer. They make our Website easier for you to use because they save your preferences while you are at our sites (although we do not save passwords in cookies). Cookies also help us know which areas are your favorites, which need a bit of improvement, and what technologies and Internet services our visitors are using. Knowing this information helps us continually improve the online experience for our visitors and members. 

The non-personally identifiable information we track with cookies is anonymous and is not used to identify, or lead us back to, any particular visitor. Visitors to Learning Network may have the option of disabling cookies via their browser preferences (most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies). 

While browsing through Learning Network, you may get cookies from our advertisers or sponsors. Learning Network and its affiliated sites do not control these cookies. 

What are IP Addresses?

An IP address is a number automatically assigned to your computer whenever you use the World Wide Web. Web servers--the big computers that "serve up" Web pages--automatically identify your computer by its IP address. 

Learning Network collects IP addresses for system administration; to report aggregate information to our advertisers, sponsors, and partners; and to audit the use of our site. When visitors request pages from Learning Network sites, our servers log the guests' IP addresses. We normally do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that a visitor's session will be logged, but the visitor remains anonymous to us. We can and will use IP addresses to identify a visitor when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our rules or terms of service, or to protect our service, site, customers, or other individuals. 

Some features within Learning Network, such as certain message boards, may display IP addresses along with the message-poster's visitor name and message. You should review each feature prior to use and only use those that disclose information you are comfortable sharing. 

A Notice About Our Advertisers:

Learning Network uses an outside advertising company to display ads on our site. These ads may contain cookies. While cookies received with banner ads are collected by our ad company, Learning Network does NOT work with any partners who do not comply with our privacy policy guidelines. 

A Notice About External Links:

Occasionally, you will find links from Learning Network to independently owned, controlled, and/or managed Websites whose content we believe will be of possible interest and value to our visitors. Additionally, you'll see links from advertisers, sponsors, and other partners who may use Learning Network's logo as part of a co-branding agreement. 

In many cases, these links represent cooperative projects or mutual links established with the organizations connected with these sites. We don't control the content of these links. These other sites may send you their own cookies, collect data, or solicit personal information. While we identify sponsor and advertiser areas of our Websites, we do not control these cookies or the content of these third parties. 

Learning Network has partnered with other companies to provide certain services. In some cases, while you may see Learning Network's logo on another company's site. Learning Network does not share any of your personally identifiable information with these partners and they do not share any information back with us. Once you leave our servers (you can generally tell where you are by checking the URL in the location bar on your browser), the use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site you are visiting. That policy may differ from ours. If you can't find the privacy policy of any of these sites via a link from that site's Home page, you should contact the site directly for more information. 

We specifically recommend that children check with their parents or teachers before clicking on to any new sites. 

Public Forums:

Learning Network makes chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available to its users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information. Consequently, you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. 

To the extent that portions of Learning Network, such as chat rooms or bulletin boards, provide users an opportunity to post and exchange information, ideas and opinions ("Postings"), BE ADVISED THAT LEARNING NETWORK MAY NOT SCREEN, EDIT, OR REVIEW POSTINGS PRIOR TO THEIR APPEARANCE ON LEARNING NETWORK, and Postings do not necessarily reflect the views of Learning Network. Learning Network reserves the right to monitor all Postings and to remove any which it considers offensive or otherwise in violation of our legal Terms and Conditions. Please read these [Terms of Use](http://learningnetwork.com/resources/agreeDisclaim.html), according to which Learning Network will in no way be responsible or liable for the Postings. Here’s more legal notices regarding Postings: You must have all necessary rights in and to all Postings you provide and all material they contain; your Postings must not infringe any proprietary or other rights of third parties; your Postings must not contain any viruses or other contaminating or destructive devices or features; your Postings must not contain any defamatory, indecent, offensive, tortuous, or otherwise unlawful material or content; and your Postings must not be used to carry out or solicit any unlawful activity and/or be used to make commercial solicitations. Also, you authorize Learning Network to use and/or authorize others to use all or part of your Postings in any manner, format, or medium that Learning Network or such other parties see fit; and you shall have no claim or other recourse against Learning Network for infringement of any proprietary right in Postings. 

Security and Credit Card Use:

Learning Network has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. Essentially, we encrypt all transmission of sensitive data and secure all of our repositories of data. When you use your credit card to shop at Learning Network Store, your transaction is secure. Our servers use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), an advanced encryption technology that works with Netscape Navigator (versions 2.0 and above), Microsoft Internet Explorer (version 3.0 and above), and AOL (AOL 3.0 and above). This technology safeguards your personal information and privacy. However, you should understand that "perfect security" is never guaranteed.
