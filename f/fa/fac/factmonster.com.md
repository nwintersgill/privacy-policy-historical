We are also extremely sensitive to family and educator concerns about their children's personal information and safety. We want you to know about and understand the measures we have taken to keep Infoplease a safe and secure environment for everyone. This privacy statement tells you how and why we collect information from you, and how we use that information. Please note that your use of this Site is also subject to the [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/web/20060616192412id_/http%3A//www.factmonster.com/pages/termsofuse.html) (of which this privacy statement is a part) posted on this site.

## Information You Provide to Us

Infoplease collects information in several ways via different parts of our site. Providing personal information and becoming a Infoplease member is voluntary. Nonmembers can still use the majority of our site. However, nonmembers will not have the opportunity to access certain enhanced content and application areas, win our seasonal promotions, experience future personalization, and voice their questions and concerns as quickly. When you register with Infoplease, you provide personal information. Infoplease uses this information to better create and organize our content programming to meet your needs.

The personally identifiable information we may request from you, and with which we identify you as a member, includes the following: first name, last name, email address, gender, date of birth, ZIP code, username, and password.

Please note: Children under the age of 13 and non-US residents currently cannot become Infoplease members.

## How We Use the Information You Provide

Infoplease uses your personal information to tailor the content programming, information services, and software applications that we provide to meet your needs and interests. When you conduct a transaction through this site, you are providing transaction information to Infoplease's third party suppliers (such as transaction processors and financial institutions) who will use the information solely for the purpose of the transaction. Finally, there may also be other third party vendors who supply software applications, web hosting and other technologies for this site that may have access to your personal information but they will never use such information for any other purpose except to provide services in connection with this site. Infoplease will not share any personal information about you with any third party (a party not affiliated with Pearson Education, Inc.), except as otherwise stated herein and in the following circumstances: (a) in response to subpoenas, court orders or legal process, to the extent permitted and as restricted by law; (b) when disclosure is required to maintain the security and integrity of this site, or to protect any user's security or the security of other persons, consistent with applicable laws; (c) when disclosure is directed or consented to by the registered member who has inputted the personal information; (d) in the event that Infoplease itself or any of its subdivisions or units goes through a business transition, such as a merger, divestiture, acquisition, liquidation or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred; or (e) in limited circumstances, Infoplease may disclose your email address in order to comply with laws and regulations, including the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act (CAN-SPAM of 2003). Infoplease may occasionally involve a paying or nonpaying partner in our registration areas because they share our educational mission and they provide a highly valued service to our members.

Infoplease also collects non-personally identifiable information. Here, no audience members are identified by their personal information â€” we are only interested in how Infoplease looks demographically and statistically. This basic market research allows us to identify the trends, developments, and needs of our audience. Such information may be shared with third parties.

## We Protect Kids' Privacy

Infoplease encourages parents and guardians to spend time online with their children. We urge parents to instruct their children to never give out their real names, addresses, or phone numbers without permission when using the Internet. We recognize a special obligation to protect personal information obtained from children.

As a parent, you've probably done a lot of thinking about protecting your family's privacy on the Internet. We have been thinking and working hard to provide you with the best information and the highest quality interaction on the Internet in an environment that is safe. In compliance with COPPA (the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act), we have adopted the following policies to keep kids safe (there are a few exceptions to these policies as noted below under the heading "Exceptions to Verifiable Parental Consent"):

  1. We will NOT knowingly collect, use, or distribute personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13 without prior verifiable consent from a parent or guardian.
  2. Personally identifiable information we collect from children under the age of 13 will be used solely by Infoplease or its agents for internal purposes only and will NOT be sold or otherwise distributed to third parties.
  3. We will NOT knowingly allow children under the age of 13 access to chat rooms, message boards, email accounts, or other services within Infoplease that would allow them to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable information without prior verifiable consent from a parent or guardian.
  4. We will NOT knowingly ask a child under the age of 13 to divulge more information than is needed to participate in any activity, game, or service.
  5. We will NOT knowingly keep any personally identifiable information that is inadvertently included in a child's email submission, help inquiry, or other one-time request, if we know that the child is under the age of 13. Information will be automatically purged or purged immediately after the issue has been resolved.
  6. We will NOT knowingly post any personally identifiable information that is inadvertently included in a child's submission to a general audience contribution area if we know that the child is under the age of 13. These submissions will be deleted and handled anonymously thereafter.
  7. We will NOT knowingly provide any direct link to websites that are unsuitable for children or teens.
  8. We will advise children under the age of 13 that they MUST obtain permission from their parent or guardian before sharing ANY personal information.
  9. Upon request, Infoplease will provide a parent or guardian with a description of the information that may have been provided about their child during a registration process for a program or service of this site. Infoplease only asks for a child's or teen's personal information if it is necessary to participate in the program or service.



### Notification and Verifiable Parental Consent

Before any personally identifiable information is collected, we will do our best to notify the parent or guardian that their child is participating. Notification will include the exact nature and intended use of the information we are collecting, as well as the opportunity for the parent or guardian to prevent the use of the information and the child's participation in the activity. For every child (anyone under 13 years of age) we require the parent or guardian to provide verifiable parental consent such as an email, mail-in letter, fax, or toll-free phone call to Infoplease.

### Exceptions to Verifiable Parental Consent

There are few instances where we will NOT get verifiable parental consent, such as:

  * Requesting the contact information of a parent or guardian for the sole purpose of obtaining verifiable parental consent or providing notification to the parent or guardian;
  * Collecting a child's contact information solely to directly respond to the child's request on a one-time basis (for example, to provide assistance with a particular study question),. We will not use that information to re-contact the child for any other purpose (we will purge from our system the child's personal information after responding);
  * Collecting a child's contact information and the contact information of his/her parent or guardian solely to directly respond more than once to a specific request from the child (for example, to satisfy the request for a newsletter subscription). In this instance, the parent or guardian will be notified that the child made such a request and be informed of the information provided by the child. The parent or guardian will have an opportunity at any time to revoke the child's request (i.e., unsubscribe). We will not use the child's personal information to re-contact the child for any other purpose.



## What Are Cookies?

The use of "cookies" is common in the Internet industry; you'll find them used on Infoplease, as you will at other major websites. "Cookies" are small text files written to your computer. They make our website easier for you to use because they save your preferences while you are visiting our sites (although we do not save passwords in cookies). Cookies also help us know which areas are your favorites, which areas need improvement, and what technologies and Internet services our visitors are using. Knowing this information helps us continually improve the online experience for our visitors and members.

The non-personally identifiable information we track with cookies is anonymous and is not used to identify, or lead us back to, any particular visitor. Visitors to Infoplease may have the option of disabling cookies via their browser preferences (most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies). While browsing through Infoplease, you may get cookies from our advertisers or sponsors. Infoplease and its affiliated sites do not control these cookies.

## What Are IP Addresses?

An IP address is a number that is assigned automatically to your computer whenever you use the World Wide Web. Web servers -- the big computers that "serve up" Web pages -- automatically identify your computer by its IP address. Infoplease collects IP addresses for system administration; to report aggregate information to our advertisers, sponsors, and partners; and to audit the use of our site. When visitors request pages from Infoplease sites, our servers log the guests' IP addresses. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that a visitor's session will be logged, but the visitor remains anonymous to us. We can and will use IP addresses to identify a visitor if the following occurs: (a) in response to subpoenas, court orders or legal process, to the extent permitted and as restricted by law; (b) when disclosure is required to maintain the security and integrity of this site, or to protect any user's security or the security of other persons, consistent with applicable laws

## A Notice About Our Advertisers:

Some of the Infoplease sites allow advertising by third parties. Infoplease does not control linking practices of advertisers or sponsors and does not monitor or claim responsibility for any content or privacy practices of such websites. Once you have clicked on an advertisement and have left the Infoplease site, you must read the privacy policy of the advertiser or sponsor to see how your personal information will be handled.

Infoplease may offer contests, sweepstakes, and promotions that are sponsored by third-party advertisers or sponsors. These third parties may obtain personally identifiable information that visitors voluntarily submit to participate in the activity. Infoplease does not control the third parties' use of information.

Infoplease may use an advertising server developed by a third party to display ads on our site. Some of these ads may contain cookies that are set by third parties (advertisers, sponsors). We do not have access to these cookies or any information that they contain. The Infoplease privacy policy does not cover any use of information that a third-party ad server may have collected from you.

## A Notice About External Links

Occasionally, you will find links from Infoplease to independently owned, controlled, and/or managed Websites whose content we believe will be of possible interest and value to our visitors. Additionally, you'll see links from advertisers, sponsors, and other partners who may use Infoplease's logo as part of a co-branding agreement.

In many cases, these links represent cooperative projects or mutual links established with the organizations connected with these sites. We don't control the content of these links. These other sites may send you their own cookies, collect data, or solicit personal information. While we identify sponsor and advertiser areas of our Websites, we do not control these cookies or the content of these third parties.

Infoplease has partnered with other companies to provide certain services. In some cases, you may see Infoplease's logo on another company's site. Infoplease does not share any of your personally identifiable information with these partners and they do not share any information with us.

Once you leave our servers (you can generally tell where you are by checking the URL in the location bar on your browser), the use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site you are visiting. That policy may differ from ours. If you can't find the privacy policy of any of these sites via a link from that site's Home page, you should contact the site directly for more information.

We specifically recommend that children check with their parents or teachers before connecting to any new sites.

## Public Forums:

Infoplease makes chat rooms, forums, message boards, web pages, and/or news groups available to its users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information. Consequently, you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.
